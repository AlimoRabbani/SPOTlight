                            SPOT* makes offices more comfortable and office buildings more energy efficient.
                            It has a temperature sensor, a motion sensor, and a fan/heater which are all connected to
                            a Raspberry Pi. SPOT* learns user preferences during a training period and uses that
                            training to control the fan/heater.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Using the motion sensor, it understands when the station is occupied, so it does not
                            heat or cool when it is not necessary. Using the temperature sensor and the training,
                            it knows when it should heat, cool, or simply do nothing. With its flexible architecture,
                            we can easily make it privacy-preserving, or potentially, energy-aware.
                        </p>

                            This work extends prior work on the SPOT and SPOT+ personal thermal
                            control systems. Both systems use the Predicted Personal Vote (PPV) model
                            to automatically adjust room heating to maintain a desired comfort level.
                            SPOT is <em>reactive</em>, in that it only heats the room when the worker
                            is actually present, and SPOT+ is <em>pro-active</em>, pre-heating the workspace before
                            the arrival of the worker, or turn off heating in anticipation of the worker's departure.
                            SPOT* differs from both systems in five significant ways. First, it controls <em>both</em>
                            heating and cooling, so can be used both in winter and in summer. Second, it is about
                            an order of magnitude <em>less expensive</em>. Third, it implements an innovative
                            software architecture that allows <em>flexible tradeoffs</em> between cost, privacy,
                            and data durability. Specifically, it allows most software components to execute either on
                            the thermal controller, in the Internet cloud, or on the worker's smartphone.
                            Fourth, the use of a fan instead of a radiant heater makes it possible to
                            <em>rapidly react</em> to worker discomfort. Finally, it is far less intrusive than
                            our two prior systems, because it does not use a camera.

                    <h4>Goals</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Reduce Cost</strong>
                            Our primary design goal is to reduce the price of SPOT*,
                            compared to SPOT. The main reason our two prior systems were
                            expensive was because they monitored workers using a Kinect camera
                            that is directly connected to a powerful processing unit (i.e. a PC with Microsoft Windows)
                            which accounts for about 50% of the overall system cost.
                        </li><br/>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Allow both Cooling and Heating</strong>
                            A secondary design goal is for SPOT* to provide comfort both in
                            summer and in winter, unlike SPOT, which only addressed heating.
                        </li><br/>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Keep User Data Private</strong>
                            User occupancy data is inherently private information that should not
                            be exposed to third parties. We would like to guarantee this
                            despite allowing SPOT* to be on the Internet.
                        </li><br/>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Improve User Experience</strong>
                            SPOT's infrared camera, used for clothing level detection,
                            closely tracks user movements. Some users found this unnerving,
                            and therefore, one of our goals in building SPOT* is to not require
                            observation of users with a web or infrared camera.
