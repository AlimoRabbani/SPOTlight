            <p>
                A group of researchers at University of Waterloo started this project.
                The project belongs to <a href="http://iss4e.ca">ISS4E Lab</a> and is supervised by
                <a href="http://blizzard.cs.uwaterloo.ca/keshav/">Prof. Keshav</a>.
                Currently, <a href="http://onible.com/">Alimohammad Rabbani</a>, Milad Khaki, and Costin Ograda-Bratu

            <h2>What is this website?</h2>
            <p>
                This website is created primarily for users to control and monitor their SPOTlight instances.
                It also provides admin tools to monitor the deployment and start troubleshooting if something goes wrong.
                The website also provides a brief description of SPOTlight for people who are interested in this kind of research.
